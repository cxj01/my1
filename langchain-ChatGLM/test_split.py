result = p(documents='1 The Breakout of the Ukrainian Conflict Ukraine, Malorussia in the Russian Czarist language, is the arguable geopolitical question in Eastern Europe which seems to be so close to the reacquainting its stability and rebuilding it is democracy.The territory has been transformed in the principle structure of political forces: the border lines defined and determined by historical glories and wounds and the people, suffering and hopeful to the present and the future.Analyzing Bertrand Badie, we affirm that the territory remains in the universe of meanings diverse as the culture might be.Should we associate the territory of the Sovereign Ukraine with a permanent conflict in the geopolitical reading of the territory?The territory is not in the conflict due to the global networks or the international communication systems.New times and actual ongoing do not offer us new clues for reading of the already existed conflict.Here, on the Ukrainian territory, although the national identity is becoming stronger; the accumulating diversity envisages the incomprehensible conflict, deep and upset.The Ukrainian conflict offers us the possibility to view the situation in Eastern Europe from different points: the actions are no more the national or nationalist issue, though the stability of the population and it’s integration in the sustainable development of all spheres, economic, social, political and environmental.Very often, the conflict is seen either form the historic point or from the politically tolerant point.The country, as Ukraine with the great historic heritage, with interesting and various cultural traditions has been suffering.Might we say that the suffering, the national pain is caused by the geographically strategic role?The territory borders with five different states, the etymology of the name means ‘near the end’ or ‘at the border’.For centuries the territory has been playing the key role in relationship between Russia and Europe: ‘the very end’ of Europe and Russia, and the very beginning of the mutual comprehension and cooperation still to be found.The curve of national self identity pushes the territory from being the integrated part of a huge politic - economic organism to being the sovereign and free space in any choice; any decision made, and then follows the innovative manoeuvre in acquiring the absolutely different role of a mediator.Through different studies and historical experiences, the role of a mediator is the most complex in its ambiguity.The European Union cannot ignore the relevant importance of the democratic development, as Ukraine is its border country with the enormous territory of 600 000 sqkm and constantly growing GDP, the territory has evident problems historically gained and aggravated in recent decades.On the other side, the Russian Federation, traditionally historic partner, desires the economic stability and prosperity of the cultural investment.Two approaches have more in common, and the diversity is the reaction towards politic changes.The Russian definition of Ukraine as a ‘younger Rus brother’ with the Golden Age of Kiev enjoyed commonly could not be cancelled from the genetic memory.Whilst the case is not a blood relationship but the mutually based economic growth.The Common European Economic space stipulates the cooperation between Russia and Europe and involves such countries as Ukraine, Moldova and Belorussia, and the territory which could become the free market space is deformed by national instability.The result appears to be painful and desperate: recent drastic events are the best prove that the necessity to receive help is no more a polite request but the national demand.Any bilateral dialogue will bring to no positive conclusion of the situation; here the multinational sustainment of the Ukrainian stability is an unavoidable exigency.2 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EURASIAN ECONOMIES 2014 2 The Regional Tendencies of the Ukrainian Development.Ukraine, as the European territory, represents the most vivid example of the powerful concept in the regional terminology.The urban, economic, sociological sciences of the Ukrainian region have been influenced by the geographic importance.This region reflects not only the geographical space on the Eurasian continent but the relationship which should exist In the moment of the exercised decision making starting from the heart of the region and emphasized in each local unit.For this reason, the Ukrainian territory enjoys its natural value ens realis, and thus, the well structured territorial organization is cohesive.It is not perceived only as a geographic space within the cultural national limits though the deep comprehension of the territory goes further: acting as a democratically stable organism it becomes more productive in the terms of the sustainable development in all spheres, economic, political, social and environmental.Though the Ukrainian space is still a transit economy region, the social tendency towards stability is vividly demonstrated by the citizens of the country, their desire is of great importance which is beneath its actual role.Any political talk on the territory is the regional choice, unavoidably indulges the social sphere, the economic growth and the environmental issue.The complete equilibrium is the wished final goal.2.1 The Historical Experience within the Ukrainian Conflict.Various scenarios are probable for Ukraine and the multilateral relations within the triangular, where each vertex is a huge economical power based on sustainable development in economical, social, political and environmental spheres.Firstly, the Ukraine’s people go to polls and the results are predictable: they express the wish of a new Ukraine state, the new political format without any obsolete mechanism.Plato, projecting the utopian city with politicians who treat the sons of the others as their own children, where a governor has no evident economic interests, thus, Plato kept in mind Syracuse, the heart of the Mediterranean region overwhelmed with great historic events, battles, victories and loses.The history of the Mediterranean region is an example of suffered tolerance and cured historic wounds.Imagine, to project the same in the Ukrainian territory, the place of suffering and inhuman desperation.The county involvement in various revolts, strikes, armed conflicts is a cry for Help, maybe, addressed to small singular groups, organizations, public persons.But still it’s a cry to be heard and to be resolved.The elections should bring the stability for at least five or six years, as any other brusque changes are harmful.Any choice is of evident responsibility, as the promises are to be maintained.No slide victory!The deep analyses!Secondly, any newly formed power has to withstand the old questions and issues, probably, ignored on purpose or by negligence.No one expects any more an institutional talk, but well planned programs applied and realized step by step.The perfect programming has to include different interests, both national and international.As the desire to the Ukrainian territory as a mediator and a decision maker in the Eastern Europe means the philosophical approach to the national diplomacy.Pro - European whether pro - Russian streams are not an excuse for errors.The affirmed position guaranties the stability and the world recognition.The big game on the international arena is a vertiginous and immodest kaleidoscope: impotence, connivance, ignorance, irresponsibility, emotive relations and other movements of a tragic ballet.The future of the Ukrainian state is a carrier?Each actor should be able to play well one’s own role.Thirdly, the great wish to restart, in the latent language of mute things, is to forget the past and rewrite the present.In the theory of catastrophes, they say that any drastic change is not a plan of breaking, we are not facing, in presence but only apparently, the theory of variation and a fracture and a discontinuity appearing essential as external facts, which disturb the normal rhythm of the evolution.It’s a long route of Braudel, beneath the incidents, beneath the vicissitudes that color and sign the destiny, in their long living or better in their permanence, in their structures, in their essential schemes would recompose a culture, a civilization which is not a given economy or a given society but the one, which through the series of economies, through the series of societies, continues the proper existence blending a bit.The way to perceive the value of the territory is the tradition that becomes stronger and seems to cast further ahead; it seems to interpose in future which is already visible.2.2 The International Involvement in the Ukrainian Conflict.The conflict which appears to be worse than all the participants might have expected has to be transformed in the international arena of mutual cooperation, as not all the keys have been tried to open the door for the diplomatic negotiation.Various key players of the European and international scenes want the leading part.I doubt that the world is attentive enough to the voices of all Ukrainians.Similar conflict is recalled in the former Yugoslavia.The Balkans with their rich ethnical, cultural and linguistic diversity painfully gained its stability though per aspera ad astrum, only now people are dreaming quietly.Might Ukraine be the second wound in modern Europe?The question of the territorial integrity is the stumbling point and has already provoked many anxieties among Eurasian and American minds.No one wants an open conflict with the other side, thus we think over the possible solution to the existed and predictable situation.The Ukrainian political instability in recent years proved to be an upsetting issue for Europe, Russia, America, though the evident international geopolitical asymmetry stands beyond the Crimea.SESSION 3 The institutional binding, the historical re-integration of experienced political movements into new ones, the cultural outstanding, the comprehension of the world as a multi-powerful structure, the innovative goals in technology and education, the global climate changes, new priorities in almost every sphere and so on, this is only the shortest list of inquiries to envisage by all the participants.The Ukrainian conflict should be solved soon and with less possible losses for each confidential party, the methods and approaches to solve the dilemma could be different, but my message is to be oriented to a gradual change with the participation of all interested parties, the Ukrainian drama is not and should not be considered at any circumstances the stumbling point for the international dialogues which have been established after the crash of the Berlin Wall.Democracy is the endless path; the international relationship is subject to new dialogues, new openings, and innovative techniques in negotiating.No doubt, the diplomacy approach to the study of democratization in Ukraine is the best fit.3 The Dynamic Transition of the Ukrainian Conflict Are we willing to underline the contours of a geopolitical and geo-economic situation on the Ukrainian territory?The Ukrainian conflict has reached the breaking point and the society has been fractured into lapillus; the leaders are facing the multitude of social groups which rap present various political interests, different historical approaches and rich cultural background.On the one hand, the essence of a power based integration of the Ukrainian societies is linked to the regional cooperation and to the national security interests, from which follows that many regions of the Ukrainian territory are historically, traditionally connected to external dominating forces and the multi linking system is proved to be weak due to the lack of democratically oriented institutions.The external force has been supplying the rules and sanctions to regulate the cooperation mechanisms, the rules and sanctions were efficient in the regions of the direct influence of the external dominant, but at the same time they weaken the national democratically governmental institutions which saw their role in the mediating among all the external forces presented in the regional multitude putting at risk the integrated system of the national security.On the other hand, the demand for regional integration of the Ukrainian territory has need dictated not only by the global economic outgoing but by the preferences of key domestic interest groups.The government has felt weak and exhausted in the post soviet period and has to recreate itself to be responsive to the impulsively growing social demands.The natural reaction is to integrate economic groups to satisfy social demand of welfare by the advanced cooperation at the regional level.And when we say “cooperation” we imply the rescue of nation - state of the Ukrainian territory by creating the economic conditions to guaranty the continued allegiance of the citizens.Thirdly, the identity based approach focuses the social identification of populations within the Ukrainian territory in the economic and political spheres as a resource for the regional integration and nation state security and the tolerance learning.Though the social assimilation did not bring to the adoption of legal and institutional frameworks.The emergence of a shared regional identity on the Ukrainian territory leads us to the conclusion that the social and economical integration of the Ukrainian regions is far from the common European democratical integration.No one argues that the way the conflict outburst has no legal or human background, despite the abandon choice of democratically oriented instruments to solve the social conflict.The Ukrainian tendency is to stabilize the local nation - state hegemony which is the maternal cry for the national sustainability.How could it be realized in practice and not in theory?The ruined economy, the inherited and aggravated environmental problems, the social disorientation, the demographic gaps, these are some problems to withstand in short terms, and the state is to seek for the external help and some international exponents will be eager to offer the ready made solutions and know how techniques, these external powers are stronger and again they would impose rules and sanctions.It seems to be a spiral development: the similar circle formed route but ungraded.4 Conclusion To conclude, the alarming situation in Ukraine is solvable with the tendency to express pro - national preferences in the next elections, which, in their turn, will be the start point for the future economic and political development and growth.')
